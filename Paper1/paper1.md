In this paper, we present a system that can learn to do the same: capturing special characteristics of one image collection
and figuring out how these characteristics could be translated into the other image collection, all in the absence of any paired
training example

The passage you provided is discussing a problem in computer vision called "image-to-image translation." This refers to the process of converting an image from one representation of a scene to another, such as from grayscale to color or from an edge-map to a photograph.

Traditionally, this process has been done in a supervised setting, where a computer program is trained using pairs of example images that show both the input image and the desired output image. However, obtaining these pairs of images can be difficult and expensive, especially for complex tasks like artistic stylization or object transfiguration.

The authors propose an alternative approach to this problem that **doesn't require paired training data**. Instead, they seek to learn a mapping between the two domains of images (e.g., grayscale and color) without any supervision at the level of individual pairs. They do this by training a mapping function G that converts images from domain X to domain Y, and an inverse mapping function F that converts images from domain Y back to domain X. By **training both of these functions simultaneously and adding a "cycle consistency loss" that encourages the output of G and F to be similar to the original input images**, they can learn to translate between the two domains without any paired examples.


G(X) - Y
F(Y) - X

Also,
F(G(x)) ≈ x 
G(F(y)) ≈ y

In the authors' work, they introduce a similar cycle consistency loss to ensure consistency between the mapping functions G and F.
